	<h2>Why use HTML and CSS?</h2>
    <p>HTML and CSS are the most widely used web programming languages in the world supported by all web browsers and have been used to code this website.</p>
	<p>The easiest way to write a perfectly optimised page for SEO is using HTML syntax and CSS styling.</p>
	<p>These programming languages are not very hard to learn and use but do take some time and concentration. It is easy for an experienced user like me to pick up the basics so i built it from scratch.</p>
	<p>CSS allows you to achieve consistency in your design with the ability to apply styling from one file that applies to all pages. This also speeds up the styling process and makes it easy to update.</p>
	<p>Experts in web design will use a variety of web techniques and languages to create stunning websites but most web development tools support HTML.</p>
	<p>Users with no web experience requiring a custom built website have many options available with varying capabilities, costs and levels of control.
	<p>The next site i code will include comments in the CSS StyleSheet. It is useful to include comments in CSS code to help with locating particular sections when debugging.</p>

    <h3>Evaluation</h3>
	<h4>CSS Frameworks can speed up the process of coding and actually help you learn how to code in CSS. They have built in support for many browsers eliminating the need to code all the croos-browser support into your site.
	The grid system used by CSS frameworks offers a fluid and responsive layout with ease. These frameworks usually come with a mass of support documentation which is extremely useful for new users but some people despise the amount of files that come withusing a framework.
	The first time you use a framework it can take some getting used to, so the repetitive use of the same one will increse web development speeds dramatically. If you are used to a certain programming language it can seem 
	restrictive having to use the frameworks own class and ID names.</h4>
	<h4>Content Management Systems can save a lot of time spent developing a custom built website. It stores all your web files in a central location making it easy and quick to perform updates and add new pages and features. 
	They offer built in security and easy to use tools to add interactivity and functionality to your site. Like CSS frameworks, CMS can contain hundreds of files making it harder to find errors in coding and also makes the site slower at 
	loading. They mainly use templates for designing which means some sites can end up looking quite similar but designing your pages is simple, using a drag and drop approach. CMS can be costly requiring training on the use of the CMS and maintenace costs can arise if things go wrong.</h4>
	<h4>Rich Internet Applications are not supported on all browsers as they are designed to run on certain platforms. A great feature of RIAs is automatic updates. These web applications can also be used offline. 
	An RIA is a web application with the look, feel and features of a desktop application for example Google Maps, which you can create using software like the Google Web Toolkit, JavaScript Libraries, Adobe Flash Builder and Microsoft Silverlight.</h4>

  <div class="right">
    <h2>Why use JavaScript(JS)?</h2>
	<p>Javascript adds functionality to a website, for example online shopping facilities. This is an informational, static website, built simply to describe and evaluate the process of web design and development.</p>
	<p>Javascript has been used in this site to develop a Top Of Page button that appears to float when you scroll the page and, to embed a Google Map. These buttons are always useful when you have lengthy pages to help the user 
	quickly get back to the navigation bar.</p>
	<p>JavaScript is a little more complex and harder to learn than HTML and CSS, requiring a basic understanding of programming including variables and functions. Most web developers now posses skills in JavaScript.</p>
	<p>Modern browsers have well-implemented JavaScript built in so it is on the client side, reducing strain on the server side.</p>
	<p>Although JS offers dynamic content with added funcionality and a great user experience, it is often used for quite the opposite purpose. For example those pop up windows including advertisments that block out the content of the site.</p>
  </div>
</div>
<div style="background-color:#e5e5e5;text-align:center;padding:10px;margin-top:7px;">
	<h2>Design Justifications of this site</h2>
	<p>The Navigation Bar could be set out better, especially for mobile devices, maybe including a drop down menu. JavaScript could also be used to make the nav bar active which would highlight to the user which page they are
	currently on.</p>
	<p>Mobile responsiveness is built in to this site using a media query that alters the viewing width at 620px and this site also adapts to different screen sizes.
	<p>The contact phone number and email address in the footer of these web pages are links that open up an application on your viewing device. This is especially useful on smartphones where it will redirect you to 
	your phone log or registered email account with the addresses already input, ready for you to communicate easily with the business.</p>
	<p>There are not many images within this website as they are not neccessary for its purpose. In a business website, high quality product photos and brand logos can help promote your brand. They should be relevant and have relatively
	small file sizes so they dont slow down the speed at which your site loads.</p>
	<p>This site has a a basic colour scheme and a similar look/feel to every page as it is more focused on the content rather than design, like a report. In a business website you may have standard pages like the Homepage, 
	About, Products, Delivery, FAQ, Image gallery etc, these pages should be individual and unique in terms of content and design.</p>
	<p>Adding visual icons for social media sites like Facebook or LinkedIn. Millions of social media users around the world constantly share videos, pictures and sites they like on these sites. 
	This is proceless, offer users a link that will automatically share it to their online social account and they will promote your business for you. Get your site noticed and shared! I have not included any in this site as it is not required.</p>
