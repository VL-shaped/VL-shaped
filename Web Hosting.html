	<h2>Operating Systems (OS)</h2>
	<p>Operating systems on the users computer maintain a temporary database called a DNS cache that contains a historical record of all viewed and searched web pages and websites. Before a browser sends a request to the internet, 
	the OS intercepts each one and looks up the domain name in the DNS cache database, if it is there it is loaded much quicker and easier than accessing the router and DNS Server.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="main">
    <h2>Web Server Hardware and Software</h2>
    <p>Software that uses HTTP to display web pages, it allows content to be served on the web. Apache HTTP server is web server software that is free and open source with cross platform support. It is the most widely used 
	web server software known for its reliability, speed and security. It can run on Mac, Unix, Linux and Windows systems. Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is an alternative web server software, designed for use 
	with Windows Server technologies. Known for its flexibility and user-friendly GUI. Unfortunately, it can only be used on Windows systems.</p>
	<p>A Server is a powerful computer designed to constantly run to provide resources to networks. They contain more hard disks, memory and processors than a PC (Personal Computer). When main power is lost these computers are kept running using an Uninterruptable 
	Power Supply (UPS) which is supported by a battery. Dedicated servers include Mail servers, Print servers, File servers and Web servers. Server Scripting
	Web Servers have the ability to create web page content dynamically. An example of this is a search feature for online shopping. The information searched must be up to date for the user to access the correct information 
	like how many items are left in stock. Using server-side scripting languages like PHP (Hypertext Pre-processor) and ASP (Active Server Page), live databases are queried by searches submitted by a user. These scripts then 
	generate HTML that is sent back to the user’s computer. This reduces storage requirements for the code as it is only generated when requested.</p>
	<h2>Server Operating System Software</h2>
	<p>Web Hosting servers can run on different server operating systems like Windows or Linux. When you purchase your web hosting package you will be asked which you want to use. Linux based hosting is cheaper than Windows 
	based but Windows is easier to learn how to manage with its GUI. Deciding which Operating system to use depends on what features you want on your website. Linux systems are known for being more reliable than Windows, they 
	crash less when multitasking so if your focus is on the most uptime, Linux would be a good choice. If you require specific capabilities such as a Microsoft SharePoint or Exchange server then you need Windows as Linux does 
	not support these. Hackers are also more likely to successfully breach a windows system. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) / TLS (Transport Layer Security) - The SSL/TLS was originally developed by Netscape, it is an Internet protocol that supports secure transactions. An SSL is a Security Certificate using 
	Encryption that is verified by third party to confirm who you are before access to data is granted. A website that has an SSL certificate will show as secure in your web browser.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right">
    <h2>Communication Protocols</h2>
    <p>The way that software and hardware from different manufacturers communicate is through a ‘layered’ approach. The Internet has a five-layer model known as TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol). Computer networks use Protocols 
	as a set of rules that define the rules of communication between hardware and software components. Each layer has a particular function and provides services to the layer above it. </p>
