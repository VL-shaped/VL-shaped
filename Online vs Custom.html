	<h1>Online tools vs Custom Built Site</h1>
	</br>
</div>

<div style="background-color:#e5e5e5;padding:15px;text-align:center;">
  <h2>If you want to make the most of the Internet to grow your business you need a website. You could learn to code it yourself (if you are a geek like me), but if you are not a 'computer minded' person, you could hire a 
  web developer to produce you a Custom Built website. Alternatively you could or use one of the many online tools available to help novice users</h2>
</div>

<div style="overflow:auto">

    <h3>Online Web Creation Tools</h3>
	<p>These tools offer a range of web services that are centralised for easy management and are easily understandle for any level of user. These services include a drag and drop design environment for the user, writing
	responsive code for the user in the background most likely based on a framework. They can also provide many other services including simple database management facilites, design templates, hosting, 
	technical support, SEO, security and domain name purchasing. Examples include Simbla.com, wix.com, snappages.com</p>
  </div>

  <div class="main">
    <h2>Web Development from scratch</h2>
    <p>Simple Development Software like Office applications such as Microsoft’s PowerPoint, Excel and Word can also create web page content easily by exporting data in an HTML format. This is easy to do and requires very 
	little knowledge of HTML. Adobe Flash can also be used for creating web page content for sites with more multimedia and user interaction. Basic Text Editors including Microsoft’s Notepad (comes with Windows) can be used 
	to create web pages by typing in HTML coding. Notepad ++ highlights syntax in different colours so you can clearly see different aspects of your coding (useful for debugging). Text Editors are not difficult to learn, 
	quick to load and cheap, however they do not offer any support on learning or debugging HTML and to see a preview of the page, you have to open a separate application on your computer (web browser). HTML Editing Suites such as Adobe 
	Dreamweaver (DW), ATOM, Microsoft Frontpage and Google Web Design are some popular editing suites. They mostly operate on a visual basis, allowing users to drag and drop content whilst writing the code for them. 
	This is known as a WYSIWYG tool (what you see is what you get). They also offer HTML validation services to check for errors in coding and help with design ideas. This makes page and site creation quick and easy. 
	You do not need to learn HTML, but some features of the editor can be difficult to learn. These editors can be expensive and require more computing power.</p>
	
	<h2>Differences between using Online Website Creation Tools vs Custom Built Websites</h2>
    <p>Developing a website for your business can help you in many ways including expanding your customer base and marketing to a wider audience. Hiring a web developer can be costly, but a custom-built website has many advantages. 
	It is developed to meet your specific business needs and designed with your specific user and customer requirements at its core, separating you from your competitors. This will make your website stand out from the crowd as 
	some websites can look very similar when using the same template or framework. Web developers can also focus in on your websites coding to increase page rankings in search engines and use techniques to increase the speed and 
	performance of your site. Updating and editing the content and design of your custom built site will be in the hands of a professional that can offer technical and user support.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="right">
    <h2>CMS (Content Management)</h2>
    <p>A Content Management System is a piece of software that centralises the organisation, creation, publishing and editing of web content, for example Wordpress, Drupal and Joomla. This adds ease to the whole process,
	you can quickly create attractive user interfaces and an interactive user experience with built in accessibilty features.</p>
